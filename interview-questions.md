# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is an extension that connects Javascript into HTML .

Researched answer: JSX helps REACT describe what and how a UI should look and feel. You can inject JS into HTML tags by using curly braces. //need to find a better way to word this and give more detail....

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager that was created in 2016, yarn also adds node_ modules, yarn.lock. and package json.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for Javascript, that was created by Facebook in 2016. Yarn replaces the work for npm (largest software library (super cool to know!)) client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. Yarn places dependencies locally were as npm pulls dependencies from the npm registry during every npm install. Yarn modifies in react by adding additional files such as node_modules, yarn.lock, and package j.son.

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: Lets start off by describing just a regular function, a function is created to preform a task. In order for the task to be performed, the function has to be invoked by something using "()" and can be invoked multiple times, while an anonymous doesn't need to be declared. 

Researched answer: it is a nameless function that has the purpose of being accepted in multiple times but only has a single output varible .

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: both are similar with the fact that they both are js objects except props can get passed into a a component  where a state is based only in a component

Researched answer: both are objects and hold information that determine functionality. Props can be passed into componets that is similar to a function, whereas state resides within a component where it is controlled 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: document object model 

Researched answer:DOM is an aplication programing interfaces for html and xml documents

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: Div allows a developer to tie in css into the main code, as for span, Im not quite sure to be exact. Span can also be contained in an html file but I will definitely utilize all my tool and resources in order to obtain more information about it

Researched answer: A span is similar in a  function to div, they both are used to group information within an  HTML file. Div tags allow us to utilize CSS styling in the webpage, while span allows us to apply different text stylings.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: propgraming that focuses on objects and the data that the objects hold

2. Ruby:programing lange that focuses on simplicity and productivity

3. Implicit returns: last executed  methods returns a value w/out being called.

4. Ruby blocks: they are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods

5. Ruby hashes: key value pairs
